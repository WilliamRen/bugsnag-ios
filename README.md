Bugsnag Notifier for iOS
========================

The Bugsnag Notifier for iOS has been replaced by the [Bugsnag Cocoa Notifier]() with support for both iOS and OSX. Please head there for the latest version. The new notifier versions support symbolication, so Bugsnag can now provide full stack traces in both OSX and iOS, regardless of whether symbols are stripped from the builds or not.

Old versions of this notifier are still available as tags on this repository.
